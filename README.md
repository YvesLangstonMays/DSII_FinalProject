## Objective

The goal of this project is to predict transcription factor binding sites in eukaryotic DNA using a 1 dimensional CNN. Our goal is to determine whether a 200 bp DNA sequence contains a binding site for a single transcription factor.

# Background

Transcription factors are proteins that regulate gene expression by binding to specific DNA motifs in promoter regions. Accurately predicting these binding sites can be useful for:

Synthetic biology – Designing custom promoters for gene circuits

Gene therapy – Targeted activation or repression of genes

Functional genomics – Understanding regulatory networks in eukaryotic cells

# Task Definition

Input: A 200 bp DNA sequence represented using one hot encoding

Output: Binary classification (1 = TF binding site, 0 = no TF binding site)

Approach: Train a CNN model to learn DNA sequence motifs associated with TF binding


## Example Inputs

| DNA Sequence       | Label              |
|--------------------|:------------------:|
| ATGCCGTTAGCGTAC... | 1 (Binding Site)   | 
| CGTATAGGCCGCTAA... | 0 (No Binding Site)| 

## Example Outputs


| DNA Sequence       | Probability        | Label              | 
|--------------------|:------------------:|:------------------:|
| ATGCCGTTAGCGTAC... |     0.96           | 1 (Binding Site)   | 
| CGTATAGGCCGCTAA... |     0.18           | 0 (No Binding Site)| 

# Data Source

JASPAR Database (jaspar.genereg.net) – Provides validated TF binding sites for transcription factors

Synthetic Negative Samples – Generated by shuffling non-binding sequences from background genomic DNA to balance the dataset. This prevents the model from becoming biased towards positive samples and reduces overfitting, thus decreasing false positives.

# Preprocessing Steps

One hot encode DNA sequences

Standardize all sequences to 200 bp 

Introduce small mutations to improve model generalization


# Evaluating Metric

Accuracy – Measures overall classification performance

AUC ROC – Assesses model’s ability to distinguish binding vs. non-binding sites
  - ROC Curve: This plots the True Positive Rate against the False Positive Rate at various threshold settings
  - AUC (Area Under the Curve): Smmarizes the overall performance. the closer to 1, the better the model is at distinguishing between positive and negative classes

Baseline Comparison – CNN performance will be compared to a random classifier (50% accuracy) to establish that the CNN provides meaningful improvement in predictive capability.


# Model Selection

1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are particularly effective for identifying sequence motifs in DNA because they can capture spatial hierarchies in sequential data. CNNs efficiently detect local patterns (such as binding motifs) through convolutional layers, making them suitable for biological sequence classification tasks where positional information is critical.

# CNN Design

Input Layer: One hot encoded DNA sequence

Conv Layer 1: 16 filters, kernel size = 8, ReLU activation

Conv Layer 2: 32 filters, kernel size = 4, ReLU activation

Pooling Layers: Max-pooling layers (pool size = 2) after each convolutional layer to reduce dimensionality and control overfitting.
Regularization Techniques: Dropout (rate = 0.5) applied after the Dense Layer to prevent overfitting.
Optimization Algorithm: Adam optimizer due to its efficiency and adaptive learning rate capabilities.
Learning Rate: Initial learning rate of 0.001, with adaptive adjustments using learning rate scheduling if necessary.

Flatten Layer

Dense Layer: Fully connected layer with 32 neurons

Output Layer: Sigmoid activation for binary classification

# Small Mutations to Improve Model Generalization
Small mutations, such as random substitutions (e.g., A → G) and insertion/deletion of single nucleotides at random positions, introduce realistic variability. This improves the CNN’s generalization ability, allowing it to perform better on unseen biological sequences.
